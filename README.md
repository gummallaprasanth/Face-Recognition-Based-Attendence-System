# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Overview

This is a simple Face Recognition-based Attendance System that captures and recognizes the faces of people and marks their attendance automatically. It uses a webcam to capture live images, and the system matches faces against a pre-trained dataset of registered users to record attendance.

## Features

Capture faces using webcam.

Recognize faces using machine learning models (e.g., dlib or OpenCV).

Mark attendance based on recognized faces.

Maintain a log of attendance with timestamps.

Simple and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying attendance.

## Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used to build the system.

OpenCV: For accessing the webcam and processing images.

Pandas: To maintain and export attendance logs.
